# 'Art Gallery' capstone_backend
Art Gallery is a web api built in .NET and C#. It is the back end for an art gallery website.  It is a CRUD app based on the popular website, Museum of Bad Art. Here, you can submit the worst art you come across and sort it into such categories as Awful Animals or Poor Traits.

## Continuing Goals
I'd like to add a related model of artists, so that users may also browse the site by artist. I'd also like to implement authentication so that only admins may update and delete entries on the site.
